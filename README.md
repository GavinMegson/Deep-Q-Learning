# pokemon-deep-learning

An openAI gym project for pokemon involving deep q learning. Made by myself, Sam Little, and Layton Webber.

Most of the brains are in agent_vs_agent/gym_agent_vs_agent/envs/ agent_vs_agent.py and player.py.

Requires a locally hosted node.js Pokemon Showdown server and poke-env.

Gym can be installed with 'pip install -e agent_vs_agent'.

Program can be run with 'python3 main.py'.
